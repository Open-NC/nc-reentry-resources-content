        "<p>A good place to start is the Federal Interagency Reentry Council’s <a href=\"https://www.usich.gov/resources/uploads/asset_library/REENTRY_MYTHBUSTERS.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> Reentry MythBusters website</a>. It dispels common myths about what federal benefits a person may qualify for, even if convicted of a felony. Another good resource is the <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/reentry/\" target=\"_blank\">Social Security Administration</a>, which provides information on qualifying and applying for benefits.</p>"
